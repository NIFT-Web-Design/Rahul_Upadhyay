      <h2>Flexibility with Timing, Budget, and Location</h2>
      <p>We have a number of consultants available on a full-time basis, however, we know that full-time consultants aren’t always the right choice for an organization’s project or budget. That’s why we always strive to be flexible and accommodating.
        Below are a few of the ways that we can meet your specific needs.</p>

      <div class="SecFourMain">

        <div class="secFour">
          <h3>part-time consultants</h3>
          <p>Not all positions need to be full-time. You may find that you need someone with a highly specific skill set to work on a project only part-time. We can always find the right consultants to fit your specific requirements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="secFour">
          <h3>advice on retainer
          </h3>
          <p>At times you just need a little impartial advice here and there, without the investment in a full-time consultant. We can put you in contact with the right person to answer your questions on an as-needed basis.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="secFour">
          <h3>remote consultants
          </h3>
          <p>When you need the job done right but don’t require a person in the office, we can find the right consultant at a lower cost if they work remotely.</p>
        </div>

      </div>

      <div class="SecFourMain">

        <div class="secFour">
          <h3>short-term contracts</h3>
          <p>Not every placement needs to be a 2 year contract. We recognize that many projects will require short-term work, and we are more than willing to collaborate with you to ensure the most flexible arrangement to fit your institution’s
            specific needs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="secFour">
          <h3>cost-flexible solutions
          </h3>
          <p>Whether you’d like to commit to an hourly contract or fixed-fee pricing, we offer a variety of options that allow you to meet your budget requirements. For example, in some cases, a junior consultant may be exactly what you need.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="secFour">
          <h3>custom project solutions
          </h3>
          <p>If you don’t see one solution that works for you, we are more than happy to work to fit your needs and create a fair arrangement that works for you—whether that means modifying an existing service, combining services, or having a
            consultant work on a trial-basis.</p>
